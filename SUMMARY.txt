This Sankey diagram , read from left to right, provides a summary of daily computer scan results, 
and the summarized flow of individual computers between states, one day to the next. Hovering over 
a node will highlight the inputs and outputs of that node for the day.

The chart building is handled through the initial sankey.js and supporting files from tamc/sankey. 
The current fork added data processing through data_prep.js and made some adjustments to simple.html.

Future tasks:
- Adjust colours to be colour-blind friendly
- Add labels to indicate dates above each column
- Change node names
- Add date range selector, graph height and width adjustors (not currently allowed or hard coded)
- Provide click through chart from each node showing details regarding the computers in that node (name and found vs quarantined)
- General code cleanup
- Improve run time for larger data sets.
